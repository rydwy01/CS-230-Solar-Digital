# CS-230-Solar-Digital
CS 230 Deep Learning final project by Ryan Dwyer, Yash Gupta, and Andy Huynh

Reducing energy production from carbon-emitting energy sources and moving to
clean energy sources is vital in the fight against the global climate change crisis.
A comprehensive database of the location of solar panels is important to assist
analysts and policymakers in defining strategies for further expansion of solar
energy. Building a large-scale solar project database through voluntary surveys
and self-reports is often incomplete and outdated. We have utilised high-resolution
satellite imagery to collect solar installation information by leveraging state-of-the-
art deep learning models/techniques. Our work provides an efficient and scalable
method for detecting solar panels, achieving an accuracy of 0.99 for classification
and an IoU score of 0.81 for segmentation performance.
